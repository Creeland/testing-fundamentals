# Intentions

You have a `greet` function that should greet the user by their name. That's the _intention_ behind it. And here's its implementation:

<CodeFile file="greet.js" nocopy />

Now your job is to add an automated test for the <code>greet</code> function
(you can put it in the same <code>greet.js</code> file) so you can run <code>node
greet.js</code> any time you want to check whether that functions works as
intended.

<callout-info>Remember that an automated test is a comparison between the actual and the expected values of the program.</callout-info>
