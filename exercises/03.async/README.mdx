# Testing Asynchronous Code

When writing applications, you will be creating and interacting with asynchronous code. Some examples of such code may include:

- Making an HTTP request;
- Connecting to a database;
- Awaiting a UI state (e.g. element's visibility).

And just as working with them, you will be testing them too.

With the introduction of `async/await` syntax in JavaScript, it became easier to handle asynchronicity.
