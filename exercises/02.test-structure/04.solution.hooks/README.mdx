# Hooks

First, I implement the `beforeAll()` hook by going to the `setup.js` and creating a new `beforeAll()` function that accepts a `callback` and immediately invokes it.

<CodeFile file="setup.js" range="21-23" />

<callout-warning>Here, I'm relying that the `beforeAll()` function will be called _before_ any individual tests. Actual testing frameworks usually have a runner responsible for internally orchestrating hooks and tests regardless of the invocation order.</callout-warning>

The `afterAll()` hook is a similar function that delegates the callback to when the Node.js process is about to exit (i.e. tests are finished) by adding the `"beforeExit"` event listener on the `process` object.

<CodeFile file="setup.js" range="25-29" highlight="26" />

And similar to the `test()` and `expect()` functions, I expose the `beforeAll()` and `afterAll()` hooks globally for all tests:

<CodeFile file="setup.js" range="33-34" />

Then, I go to the `greet.test.js` and add the `beforeAll()` hook that sets a global `document` property to equal an object with a `title` property. I also add the `afterAll()` hook to clean up any side-effects this test file introduces (i.e. delete the global `document` property).

<CodeFile file="greet.test.js" range="1-15" highlight="4-6,10,14" />

<callout-success>Remember the rule of clean hooks: have a cleanup for each side-effect in your setup (e.g. spawn a server → close the server; introduce a global → remove the global).</callout-success>
